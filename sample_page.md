## This is my internal website page / project page



**Page description:** I am currently building out multiple HTML websites for my Intro to Web Development Course. I thought it would be neat to share my website as it progresses as well as use github as a place to back up my code. 

What I did here was create a shared folder in my goggle drive & hosted that folder. (I know there is a way to do this in github – but I haven’t figured it out yet!) I then built out this page using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to be able to display it.  
 




### Project 1 -Pacific Trails
  Version 1 [Pacific Trails v.1](https://6l5z9ladle9ygtrkfnzxgw-on.drv.tw/HTML/PacificTrails v.1/Index.html) 
  >Alright! The website has been born, welcom to the world little guy! 

  Version 2 [Pacific Trails v.2](https://6l5z9ladle9ygtrkfnzxgw-on.drv.tw/HTML/pacific trails v.2/Index.html)
  >Here we've added a CSS Stylesheet. Now our website doesn't look like an old craigslist ad.
