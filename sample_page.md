**Page description:** I am currently building out multiple HTML websites for my Intro to Web Development Course. I thought it would be neat to share my website as it progresses as well as use github as a place to back up my code. 

What I did here was create a shared folder in my goggle drive & hosted that folder. (I know there is a way to do this in github – but I haven’t figured it out yet!) I then built out this page using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to be able to display it.
